📚 NerdWEB: From Poetry Forum to Social Network

📝 Project Description

NerdWEB began as a simple forum-style website where users could upload and share poems. However, over time, I came up with the idea of turning it into something more comprehensive: a social network focused on writing and anonymity.

The project is currently transitioning into a more robust social platform, allowing users to:

Create public or anonymous profiles
Post content
Interact with others
Maintain privacy, if they so choose

🚀 Main Features

📜 Publishing poems and writings

🔐 Registration and login with authentication via tokens and cookies

👤 User profiles:

🕶️ Anonymous profile: Interaction without revealing identity

🌐 Public profile: Interaction with a visible and personalized profile

🔄 Dynamic switching between anonymous and public profiles

🧱 Architecture ready to scale into full social network capabilities

🛠️ Technologies Used

Node.js – Main server engine
Express.js – Framework for managing routes and requests
Handlebars (hbs) – Template engine for rendering views
Local database – Currently used for development and testing
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – For secure user authentication
Cookies – For session management and access control
🚧 Current State of Development

✅ Database logic implemented
✅ Login and registration system functional
✅ Anonymous and public profile modes implemented
🔄 In progress: Route restructuring and expansion toward full social features
🔜 Coming Soon
🤝 Followers/friends system
💬 Comments and likes

🔐 Safety Notes

The authentication system uses JWT and secure cookies to ensure safe user sessions.
Additional validation and security layers will be implemented as the platform evolves.
