NerdWEB, from poetry forum to social network
project description:
NerdWEB began as a simple forum-style website where users could upload and share poems. However, over time, I came up with the idea of ​​turning it into something more comprehensive: a social network focused on writing and anonymity.
The project is currently transitioning to a more robust social network, allowing users to create public or anonymous profiles, post content, interact, and maintain their privacy if they so choose.
Main features:
-> Publishing poems and writings.
-> Registration and login with authentication via tokens and cookies.
-> User profiles:
->> Anonymous profile: Interaction without revealing identity.
->> Public profile: Interaction with a visible and personalized profile.
-> Dynamic switching between anonymous and public profiles.
-> Architecture ready to scale to typical social network features.
Technologies used:
-> Node.js: Main server engine.
-> Express.js: Framework for managing routes and requests.
-> Handlebars (hbs): Template engine for rendering views.
-> Local database: A local database is currently used for development.
-> JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication.
-> Cookies: For session management and access control.
Current state of development:
-> Database logic implemented.✅
-> Login and registration system functional.✅
-> Anonymous and public mode implemented.✅
-> In progress: Route modifications and expansion to a full social network.
-> Coming soon:
->> Followers/friends system.
->> Comments and likes.
->> Notifications.
Safety Notes:
-> The authentication system uses JWT and secure cookies.
